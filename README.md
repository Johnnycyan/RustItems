# RustScraper

This is an automated Python script which scrapes RustLabs for all
current items. 

See [Here](https://github.com/olijeffers0n/RustItems/blob/master/data/items.md) for the MarkDown version

Or [Here](https://github.com/olijeffers0n/RustItems/blob/master/data/items.json) for the JSON version

The Action will update the database every day so that.


#### To RustLabs:

This Action scrapes your site every day. I have slowed down the process to take about 10-15 minutes.

If you would like it taken down, please contact me on discord at `ollieee_`
